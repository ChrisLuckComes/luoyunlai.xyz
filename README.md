# Getting Started with Vite

This project has been migrated to [Vite](https://cn.vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
